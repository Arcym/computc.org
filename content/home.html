	We are a handful of compsci students here at UTC who just want
	to do cool stuff and make cool things, be it through techtalks,
	hackathons, competitions, or more. We like to mess around with
	just about a bit of everything, from videogame development to
	information security or robotics simulations to web design!! Do
	you want to do cool stuff and make cool things? Join us today!

	At the moment, we haven't announced our schedule for events yet.
	But we will in just a few weeks! Be sure to check back later.
	Until then, you might consider emailing your president with what
	days and hours throughout the week you are most available, so we
	can be sure to consider you while we schedule our calendar!
