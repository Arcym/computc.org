	We are a handful of compsci students here at UTC who just want
	to do cool stuff and make cool things, be it through techtalks,
	hackathons, competitions, or more. We like to mess around with
	just about a bit of everything, from videogame development to
	information security or robotics simulations to web design!! Do
	you want to do cool stuff and make cool things? Join us today!

	You may have noticed that the website has a lot of dead links. And that
	is because the website still in development! It takes a lot of work to get
	this working! If you want to contribute to the project, be sure to fork us on
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/computc/computc.org">Github</a>,
	and mess around with our website!
